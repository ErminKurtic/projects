                    <h1>WELCOME, NEW MINERS!</h1>
                    <div>Congratulations, New Dwarven Employee, on signing up for DEEP ROCK GALACTIC, and thereby making
                        the smartest decision of your life! You have just taken your first step towards becoming an
                        essential part of the most tenacious space mining corporation in the galaxy!</div>
                    <div>At DEEP ROCK GALACTIC, we pride ourselves on having obtained practical dominance of the most
                        lucrative belts of the Outer Rim. While our foolish and cowardly competitors generally regard
                        these systems as too volatile or high-risk, to us they are home.</div>
                    <div>At this time, we have a total of 87 ORBITAL SPACE RIGS in operation throughout more than a
                        dozen Outer Rim systems, with 16 more currently under construction.</div>
                    <div>However, a new mission is upon us. While our digs are many, we are currently preparing our most
                        heavily orchestrated mining operation to date: The complete subjugation of the planet HOXXES IV.
                        It is to the best of our knowledge the single most dangerous planet in the galaxy, and it just
                        so happens to contain the richest concentrations of valuable minerals ever discovered. Many have
                        tried to tame Hoxxes. All, so far, have failed. DRG is not in the business of failing.</div>
                    <div>Management bids you welcome.</div>
                </div>

                    <h2>Hotfix Updates - Hotfix 6</h2>
                    <div>Small Update - posted October 31, 2020</div>
                    <div>Hello Miners,</div>
                    <div>This hotfix includes fixes related to a couple of perks as well as some miscellaneous sound
                        improvements to everything ranging from flares to the Ommoran Heartstone! We have also resolved
                        a bug that could cause the Refinery to turn invisible to some players. Very spooky but not
                        intended! Cheers, The Ghost Ship Crew</div>
